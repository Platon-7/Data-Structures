# Data Structures

This course is from the 3rd year of my studies but officially according to the university's study guide it is a 2nd year course.
The 1st project's orientation was mostly an introduction to Java features and basic data structures so I skipped it.

## Syllabus
The syllabus of the course included:

- Introduction to algorithm analysis.
- Searching and sorting, asymptotic approximations, and notations.
- Stacks and queues: definition, operations, array-based implementation.
- Linked lists: single, double, circular linking, traversal, insertion, removal.
- Binary trees: definitions and fundamental theorems, depth-first and breadth-first traversal, recursive and iterative traversal, Euler tours.
- Binary search trees: definition, search, insertion, removal, adaptive, splay, and random binary search trees.
- Balanced search trees: AVL trees, 2-3-4 trees, red-black trees, B-trees.
- Priority queues.
- Binary heaps: definition, operations, heap-sort.
- Binary heap-based priority queues.
- Hash tables: polynomial hashing, address compression (division, multiplication, and truncation), conflict resolution (chaining, linear probing, double hashing).
- External searching.
- B-Trees and hash tables.
